# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project implements an image recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. It uses the CIFAR-10 dataset containing 60,000 images across 10 categories.

## Features
- Data normalization and preprocessing
- CNN architecture with multiple layers
- Model evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics
- Visualization of training results
- Predictions on test data

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebook in Google Colab or locally.

## Results
Achieved test accuracy of approximately 85% on CIFAR-10 after 10 epochs.
